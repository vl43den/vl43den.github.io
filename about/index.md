Hello! I'm Vlad, a cybersecurity enthusiast and aspiring security researcher. I created this site to share my knowledge and experiences with the community (also to mess around with creating stuff in general + fixing code w other maintainers, so take this as a playground).

## Certifications

- **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**
- **Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals (SC-900)**
- **CRISAM**

## CTF Experience

I actively participate in Capture The Flag competitions to sharpen my skills in areas like web exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, and forensics (love it). Check out my [write-ups](/writeups/) to see detailed solutions from events I've competed in.
