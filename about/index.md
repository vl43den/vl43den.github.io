Hello! I'm Vlad, a cybersecurity enthusiast and in the process of becoming a researcher. I created this site to share my knowledge and experiences with the community (also to mess around with creating stuff in general, so take this as a playground).

If you find this site useful, please consider writing me a message on GitHub or LinkedIn - I'd be happy to hear from you!
